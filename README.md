# DSCI 552: Statistical Inference and Computation I

The statistical and probabilistic foundations of inference, the frequentist paradigm. Concepts first introduced through simulation, followed with an introduction and exploration of asymptotic theory.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Describe the frequentist paradigm of statistical inference.
2. Select and compute appropriate estimates of statistical parameters and distributional quantities using bootstrapping and asymptotic methods.
3. Construct and run simulations to evaluate uncertainty of estimates and predictions in hypothetical situations.
4. Evaluate uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals) of estimates and predictions from data using bootstrapping and asymptotic results.
5. Explain the difference between prediction and estimation error in terms of irreducible and reducible error.
6. Carry out basic hypothesis tests in a responsible manner, and responsibly apply them in appropriate situations.
7. Explain the fundamental ideas and terminology of hypothesis testing.
8. Perform estimation using Maximum Likelihood.
